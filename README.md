- Chef Claude: A web application that allows the user to input ingredients and call an LLM to suggest a recipe. This project is used to practice react `states`
- Meme Generator: A web application that generates meme images and allows the user to caption them. It generates images by calling an external API. This project focuses on reacts `useEffect`
