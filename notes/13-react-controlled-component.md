# Controlled Component
- Components (inputs) that react has a control, does reflect the current value of state
- For example, you can put something on the input component and react does not have that info (it does not have a control)

To make it controlled
1. Be able to update state whenever there is a change in the input box
2. make the value of the component be the state:
```jsx
value={state}
```
